Short term roadmap:

Done. Change type of types with only one constructor to always have 'Just constructor' in 'types' dictionary
Done. Implement subtype check for function parameters / return type
Done. Add errors for invalid type annotations and force evaluation of unused types
Done. Add 'case' statements
5. Implement runtime for types
Done. Toy around with lists and higher-order functions
7. Add field accessor functions for mapping
8. Make records callable to modify certain fields
9. Check if 'isSameType' should be removed in favor of Eq
10. Start working on generics
